# MACCDC-Public
This is a public Repo for my MACCDC Script and is intentionally obvuscated. If you'd like to see the unobvuscated version, please contact me.

Run this at your own risk. I am not responsible for any damages that this will cause. It is obvuscated for the purpose of secrecy. I do not want the other teams to know how to run this script during the competition and it may harm your machine if you run it improperly.

As a note, This will probably be available around october 2022
